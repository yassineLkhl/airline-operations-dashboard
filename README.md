# airline-operations-dashboard
Public overview of a flight operations dashboard originally built in Palantir Foundry, with mock data, screenshots and a simplified analysis pipeline.

## Project Context

This repository provides a public overview of a flight operations analytics project originally developed inside Palantir Foundry as part of a hands-on workshop.

Within Foundry, the project included:

- a data pipeline built using Python and PySpark
- several cleaning, joining, and enrichment steps
- a visual data lineage graph showing the transformation flow
- an interactive dashboard combining filters, charts, a table, and a detailed object view

Because the original environment and datasets are not publicly accessible, this repository includes mock data, screenshots, and documentation to illustrate the work performed in Foundry.
